## üöÄ Suggested Tech Stack

**Backend (Node.js & Postgres - Extending Existing Stack)**
- **Framework:** Continue using **Express.js**.
- **Database:** Use **PostgreSQL** for relational data (Users, Posts, Replies, Tags). Define a clear schema:
  - `Forums(id, name, description)`
  - `Threads(id, forum_id, user_id, title, content)`
  - `Posts(id, thread_id, user_id, parent_post_id, content)`
  - `Reactions(id, post_id, user_id, type)`
  - `Follows(follower_id, followed_id)`
- **Real-time:** **Socket.IO** or **ws** for live notifications and real-time post updates.
- **AI Integration:** **OpenAI API (GPT-4)** for the trade summary feature.

**Frontend (React - Extending Existing Stack)**
- **Framework:** **React/Vite**.
- **State Management:** **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server state, caching, and optimistic updates. This is crucial for a responsive-feeling forum.
- **Rich Text Editor:** **Tiptap** or **Slate.js** for a modern, extensible text editor with support for mentions and custom embeds.
- **UI Components:** Continue using **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Build a library of reusable forum components (`<ThreadView>`, `<Post>`, `<Reply>`, `<UserProfileCard>`).
- **Notifications:** A library like **`react-hot-toast`** for simple, clean toast notifications.

## üé® UX/UI Inspiration

The goal is a clean, modern, and data-rich interface that feels like a professional trading tool, not a legacy forum.

- **Layout:** A multi-panel layout inspired by **Discord** and **Reddit**.
  - **Left Panel:** List of categories and followed journals.
  - **Center Panel:** Main content area for threads and posts.
  - **Right Panel (Contextual):** User profiles, thread stats, related discussions, or leaderboards.
- **Theme:** A sleek dark mode is essential for traders. The existing dark/light theme system should be extended.
- **Feel:**
  - **Reddit:** Threaded conversations, upvoting, and community-driven sorting.
  - **Discord:** Real-time updates, clear categorization of topics (channels), and a sense of "liveness."
  - **TradingView:** Clean charts, data density, and a professional, uncluttered aesthetic.
- **Gamification:** Visualize XP and badges clearly on user profiles. Use subtle animations to make earning them feel rewarding.
